假设机器有n块硬盘，前n-1块作成RAID5，第n块作成global hotspare
现在发现一块硬盘出现故障，下线，第n块热备盘会自动顶上。但是如果rebuild过程中又有
一块硬盘出现问题，rebuild就会失败，以下记录了成功和失败两种过程中各个磁盘的State。
以下记录的各个状态来自MegaCli抓取的日志

h3. rebuild磁盘过程中磁盘的State变化

对各个状态的解释可以参考附录

h3. 附. 磁盘各个状态说明

A physical disk drive property indicating the status of the drive. A physical disk drive can be in one of the following states:
    Unconfigured Good   A disk accessible to the RAID controller but not configured as a part of a virtual disk or as a hotspare.
    Online              A physical disk can be accessed by the RAID controller and is part of the virtual disk.
    Rebuild             A physical disk to which data is being written to restore full redundancy for a virtual disk.
    Failed              A physical disk that was originally configured as Online but on which the firmware detects an unrecoverable error.
    Unconfigured Bad    A physical disk on which the firmware detects an unrecoverable error; the physical disk was Unconfigured Good or 
			the physical disk could not be initialized.
                        Disks with a status of "Unconfigured bad" cannot be used for RAID configurations.
    Missing             A physical disk that was Online, but which has been removed from its location.
    Offline             The drive is offline or absent. No actions can be performed on the drive until it is back online.
    Global Hotspare     The drive will be used to repair any array in the system that had a drive failure, if the failed drive is 
			equal to, or smaller than the hot spare drive.
    Ready               The drive is online and operating correctly.
    Foreign             The drive is part of an array created on a different controller, or created within one enclosure and moved to 
			another on the same controller. It can be used to create a new array after clearing configuration.
    None                A physical disk with the unsupported flag set. An Unconfigured Good or Offline physical disk that has completed 
			the prepare for removal operation.
    copyback
